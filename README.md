# BUILDING

## Supported Platforms
Quickstart supports the main 3 desktop platforms:
* Windows
* Linux
* MacOS

# Windows Users
There are two compiler toolchains available for windows, MinGW-W64 (a free compiler using GCC), and Microsoft Visual Studio
## Using MinGW-W64
* Double click the `build-MinGW-W64.bat` file
* CD into the folder in your terminal
* run `make`
* You are good to go

# Linux Users
* CD into the build folder
* run `./premake5 gmake2`
* CD back to the root
* run `make`
* you are good to go

# MacOS Users
* CD into the build folder
* run `./premake5.osx gmake2`
* CD back to the root
* run `make`
* you are good to go

# Output files
The built code will be in the bin dir

# Working directories and the resources folder
The example uses a utility function from `path_utils.h` that will find the resources dir and set it as the current working directory. This is very useful when starting out. If you wish to manage your own working directory you can simply remove the call to the function and the header.
